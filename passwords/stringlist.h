/**
 * This is a special list of strings implementation. It is quite tailored
 * to the usecases for this assignment. It will store a list of <count>
 * strings, each of maximum length <size>.
 * 
 * The stringList will have been allocated a single large block of contiguous
 * memory of <count> * <size> bytes. Then, every <size> bytes, a new string
 * can live. The <strings> list then contains pointers to each individual string.
 * 
 * In addition to a simple implementation of this list, we have provided some
 * functions that perform manipulations on all elements in this list, such as
 * making substitutions, uppercasing random letters in the list, etc. See below
 * for a full overview.

 * For example: the string list "abc", "de" of <size> 3 and <count> 2 will

 * that is longer than that.
 * 
 * The new list <count> will be <first count> * <second count>. Any empty
 * strings in the first list will be skipped (and leave <second count> emtpy
 * strings), similar for any empty strings in the second list.
 * 
 * For example: the string lists "abc", "def" and "zyx", "wvu", both of size
